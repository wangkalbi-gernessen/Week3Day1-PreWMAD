/*I have written out the shells of some functions that you will have to create the logic for. a couple of tips:    

  1. Take your time. Think about each problem, and try to break it into its individual parts. 
     consider writing down these steps, and then try and convert them into code

  2. Run your code along the way. If you are getting strange outputs, use them to help figure out where you 
     are making your mistake. Make sure to test every function with multiple different inputs.

  3. Uncomment the function calls I have made for you at the bottom of the file in order to test your function. 
     make sure you are getting all of the expected results

// Function one: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// Should add two numbers, and console.log the result.

// Function Two: should have two parameters, meaning it will take two arguments. 
// Should multiply the two numbers, and console.log the result.

  //Your code goes here
  let result = first * second;
  console.log(result);
